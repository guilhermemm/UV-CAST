**Description**

This is an implementation of the UV-CAST dissemination protocol for Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks using the Veins simulator. Such implementation is based on the following publication:

Viriyasitavat, W., Bai, F. and Tonguz, O.K., 2010, December. UV-CAST: an urban vehicular broadcast protocol. In IEEE Vehicular Networking Conference (VNC), 2010 (pp. 25-32).

**Dependencies**

1. OMNeT++ 4.4.2
2. Veins 4.4
3. SUMO 0.25.0

**Warning**

The scenarios used to run the protocol (Manhattan Grid and TAPAS Cologne) are not available in the repository. You must create your own scenarios and adapt the protocol accordingly or ask me for the scenario files.
